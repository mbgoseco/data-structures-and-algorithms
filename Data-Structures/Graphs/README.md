# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be viewed as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges. This app demonstrates how a graph and its nodes are created, as well as how nodes are linked together.

## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
AddNode()
* Adds a new node to the graph
* Takes in the value of that node
* Returns the added node

AddEdge()
* Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
* Include the ability to have a “weight”
* Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
* Both nodes should already be in the Graph

GetNodes()
* Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

GetNeighbors()
* Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
* Takes in a given node
* Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

Size()
* Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
